# Bikeshare_databricks

Project Overview:
Building a data lake solution for bikeshare project in Azure databricks. The bike sharing program allows riders to purchase a pass at a kiosk or use a mobile application to unlock a bike at stations around the city and use the bike for a specified amount of time. The bikes can be returned to the same station or to another station. The goal of this project is to develop a data lake solution using Azure Databricks using a lake house architecture.
The star schema will be designed to reflect these business outcomes:
1.	Analyze how much time is spent per ride • Based on date and time factors such as day of week and time of day • Based on which station is the starting and / or ending station • Based on age of the rider at time of the ride • Based on whether the rider is a member or a casual rider
2.	Analyze how much money is spent • Per month, quarter, year • Per member, based on the age of the rider at account start
